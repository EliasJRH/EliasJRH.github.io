      <h2>Now about me üëã</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Chicago and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. I'm 20 years old going
        into the third year of my computer science degree at Carleton
        University. From a young age, I've always enjoyed messing around with
        technology of all kinds, which is probably why I'm doing what I do
        today. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, going on
        bike rides, and learning about new and interesting things.

        <p id="pwp1"> This past Winter term, I was a full-time student at Carleton University. 
          Some of the more exciting courses I took included COMP 2404 - where I learned about proper 
          software engineering principles, COMP 3005 - where I learned about database management
          systems and SQL and COMP 2804 - discrete mathematics.</p>

          During the Fall of 2022, I was able to secure an internship placement at IBM. I
          worked as a software developer intern on the data replication division
          of the cloud and cognitive software team. The team works on products
          that allow over 800 companies to synchronize data between systems in
          near real time.

          <br /><br />

          My biggest and most important project at IBM had me championing an
          automated system for closing customer support tickets by constructing
          unit tested workflows in Java and Python. This allowed our team to
          save nearly 4 hours every realease manually closing tickets and
          allowed customer support ticket turnover rates to skyrocket!

          For the past two years I've worked on Carleton University's
          Blueprint chapter as a backend developer. Blueprint is a student run
          organization that develops pro-bono apps for nonprofits and promotes
          tech for social good. We are currently in the process of developing a
          CRM system for an Ottawa-based non-profit
          <a href="https://beneficent.cc/"> Beneficent</a>. <br /><br />
          Working on this project has allowed me to obtain experience working on
          a fully fleshed out web application built with the MERN stack. It has
          also allowed me to make some great connections and meet some amazing
          people!
