      <h2>Now about me üëã</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Chicago and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. I'm 19 years old going
        into my second year of my computer science degree at Carleton
        University. From a young age I've always enjoyed messing around with
        technology of all kinds, which is probably why I'm doing what I do
        today. In my free time I enjoy reading, playing video games, going on
        bike rides and learning about new and interesting things.

          For the past year I've worked on Carleton University's Blueprint
          chapter as a backend developer. Blueprint is a student run
          organization that develops pro-bono apps for nonprofits and promotes
          tech for social good. We are currently in the process of developing a
          CRM system for an ottawa-based non-profit
          <a href="https://beneficent.cc/"> Beneficent</a>. <br /><br />
          Working on this project has allowed me to obtain experience working on
          a fully fleshed out web application built with the MERN stack. It has
          also allowed me to make some great connections and meet some amazing
          people!

          During the summer I was given the oppourtunity to work with the
          Carleton Computer Science Society on developing some of their
          websites. Primarily, doing frontend work for the society's official
          website alongisde a few other projects they've been working on. I was
          able to gain experience working with frameworks such as hugo and
          svelte while contributing to the society!
