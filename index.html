      <h2>Now about me 👋</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Chicago and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. I'm 19 years old going
        into my second year of my computer science degree at Carleton
        University. From a young age I've always enjoyed messing around with
        technology of all kinds, which is probably why I'm doing what I do
        today. In my free time I enjoy reading, playing video games, going on
        bike rides and learning about new and interesting things.

          For the past year I've worked on Carleton University's Blueprint
          chapter as a backend developer. Blueprint is a student run
          organization that develops pro-bono apps for nonprofits and promotes
          tech for social good. We are currently in the process of developing a
          CRM system for an ottawa-based non-profit
          <a href="https://beneficent.cc/"> Beneficent</a>. <br /><br />
          Working on this project has allowed me to obtain experience working on
          a fully fleshed out web application built with the MERN stack. It has
          also allowed me to make some great connections and meet some amazing
          people!

          During the summer I was given the oppourtunity to work with the
          Carleton Computer Science Society on developing some of their
          websites. Primarily, doing frontend work for the society's official
          website alongisde a few other projects they've been working on. I was
          able to gain experience working with frameworks such as hugo and
          svelte while contributing to the society!

          The Carleton Computer Science Society proudly represents, advocates,
          and aims to create resources for all Carleton computer science
          students. You can check out their website (that I helped create)

          In this upcoming Fall 2021 season, I'll be working on the Cloud and
          Cognitive Software team at IBM 👁️🐝Ⓜ️. In addition, I'll be taking one
          extra course at Carleton. In the upcoming Winter 2021/22 season, I'll
          be returning as a full time student at Carleton University
