      <h2>Now about me 👋</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Chicago and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. I'm 19 years old going
        into the second year of my computer science degree at Carleton
        University. From a young age, I've always enjoyed messing around with
        technology of all kinds, which is probably why I'm doing what I do
        today. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, going on
        bike rides, and learning about new and interesting things.

          This past Fall I was able to secure an internship placement at IBM. I
          worked as a software developer intern on the data replication division
          of the cloud and cognitive software team. The team works on products
          that allow over 800 companies to synchronize data between systems in
          near real time.

          <br /><br />

          My biggest and most recent project at IBM had me championing an
          automated system for closing customer support tickets by constructing
          unit tested workflows in Java and Python. This allowed our team to
          save nearly 4 hours every realease manually closing tickets and
          allowed customer support ticket turnover rates to skyrocket!

          For the past year and a half I've worked on Carleton University's
          Blueprint chapter as a backend developer. Blueprint is a student run
          organization that develops pro-bono apps for nonprofits and promotes
          tech for social good. We are currently in the process of developing a
          CRM system for an ottawa-based non-profit
          <a href="https://beneficent.cc/"> Beneficent</a>. <br /><br />
          Working on this project has allowed me to obtain experience working on
          a fully fleshed out web application built with the MERN stack. It has
          also allowed me to make some great connections and meet some amazing
          people!

          Last summer I was given the oppourtunity to work with the Carleton
          Computer Science Society on developing some of their websites.
          Primarily, doing frontend work for the society's official website
          alongisde a few other projects they've been working on. I was able to
          gain experience working with frameworks such as hugo and svelte while
          contributing to the society!
